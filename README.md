# Hackathon based on Machine Learning
Task: Generating Transcripts of audio using live Recording, also recognizing emotion from tone using various Machine Learning API's

What we've done so far
1. Created a windows application JARVIS using .NET framework.

API's used
1. IBM Watson Speech to text
2. Yandex Language translator( Supports Indian native languages like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu etc.)
3. IBM Watson Tone Analyser

Our Application JARVIS 
1. JARVIS is capable of transcribing, generating closed captioning subtitles of spoken words in various Indian Languages(Hindi, Tamil, Telugu supported only) during Live recording or from a audio file
2. JARVIS also analyses the emotion of the speaker and give summary of it.
3. Capabale of saving the transcribed words in specific file.

2. Click on the Language icon and select the preferred language.
3. Use Start and Stop button to start and stop the recording.
4. Click on the UPLOAD icon to upload the audio file(wav, mp3 supported only)
5. Click on SAVE button to save the transcript whenever required.
6. Learn from the Summary with friendly interface.

Conclusion
JARVIS is capable to record or upload audio , then trancribing it to generate closed caption subtitles of spoken words in various Indian Languages.
